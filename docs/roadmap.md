# Roadmap

This document tracks long-term goals that are not yet implemented.

## Workspace + semantic model

Planned Roslyn-style capabilities:

- Compilation model and semantic binding
- Symbol APIs and type system
- Workspace, project, and document abstractions
- Incremental analysis pipelines

These are intentionally deferred until the syntax tree and parsing layers are
stable.
